Sometime you needs to add a component (i.e. `calc` in our example) residing in your hard drive instead of project directory.     
     
In your top level _CMake_ file provide the full path to the component directory in your hard drive      
`set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS /Path/to/the/component/ESP32/11_external_components/calc)`
